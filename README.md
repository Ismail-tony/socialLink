## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

Setting the body font-size to 62.5% approximately equals to 10px, so i can use the font-size of the h1 to 1.4em which will set the h1 font to 14px because 10px x 1.4em = 14px.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
body {
  font-size: 62.5%;
}

h1 {
  font-size: 1.4em;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell - Are you using the right CSS units?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5wpD9Ov_To&t=144s) - This helped me in understanding how to use a proper responsive meaqsurement in css. This is also a great resource to go back to when i don't remember it.
